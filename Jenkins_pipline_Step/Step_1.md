## A more comprehensive Jenkins pipeline might be broken down even further into something like this:

#### 1- Pull from GitHub using the Jenkins Git plug-in.
#### 2 --Compile the application using the Jenkins Maven plug-in.
#### 3- -Ensure developers are complying with coding standards by using the Jenkins Checkstyle Plugin.
#### 4 --Calculate McCabe cyclomatic complexity, and using that data, calculate unit test coverage. The JaCoCo plug-in is often used to perform code coverage calculations.
#### 5 --Check for bugs and potential security flaws with static code analysis tools, such as SonarQube, PMD or FindBugs.
#### 6 --Obtain manual sign-off by the user acceptance team by including a Groovy script in the Jenkins pipeline.
#### 7 --un stress tests, and measure the application's performance under load.
#### 8 --Package the application in a format suitable for deployment. This is often a WAR file for web apps, an EAR file for enterprise Java apps or an executable JAR file for Docker-based microservices.
#### 9 --Deploy the application to a Maven repository, such as Nexus or Artifactory.
#### 10 --Archive all of the generated reports for future reference.
